# Triton 101

## Introduction

I am going to try out Triton server to serve LLMs and have our in-house chat system.
I have very poor system with Nvidia 2060 but hope is the only thing I have.

## Expose GPU to Docker

Use [`dotfiles`](https://github.com/1995parham/dotfiles/) as follows:

```bash
./start.sh nvidia-container 
```

## Download Model?
